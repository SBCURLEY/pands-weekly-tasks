# In algebra, a square, x, is the result of a number, n, multiplied by itself: x = nÂ²

# x ** .5 ()  -  exponent operator                   Reference: https://realpython.com/python-square-root-function/
# math.sqrt(x). - predefined function that is defined in the math module.     # Reference: https://realpython.com/python-square-root-function/

better=0.5*(approx+num/approx)                                  # find a better value using Newtons method
while (better!=approx):                                         # while better found is not equal to the assumed approx
    approx = better                                             # assume the found better value as approx 
    better=0.5*(approx+num/approx)                              # recalculate better value using formula
