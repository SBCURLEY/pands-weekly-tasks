# This program takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

# Analysis of Math
# In algebra, a square, x, is the result of a number, n, multiplied by itself: x = nÂ²
# x ** .5 ()  -  exponent operator                   
# math.sqrt(x). - predefined function that is defined in the math module.    
# An approx is made and a better value is determined based on the approx and then you keep doing that until you get the precision you desire.
# Newton theory: Let N be any number then the square root of N can be given by the formula: root = 0.5 * (X + (N / X)) where X is any guess which can be assumed to be N or 1.
